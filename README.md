Project Description:
- This is a simple console-based shopping cart program written in C++. It lets users create accounts, log in, browse a small clothing catalog, add items to their cart, and check out. The system also handles stock management and applies discounts automatically when you buy 3 or more of the same item.

Features:
- Sign up and log in with a username and password.
- View a list of clothing items with prices and available stock.
- Add items to your cart with quantity limits based on stock.
- See your cart contents with prices and discounts applied.
- Remove items from your cart and update stock accordingly.
- Checkout and get a receipt showing what you bought and the total cost.
- Input validation to make sure you don’t enter wrong or invalid data.

How to run the code:
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler (like g++).
- Run the program.
- Create an account or log in if you already have one.
- Browse the available shirts and add the ones you want to your cart.
- View or remove items from your cart whenever you want.
- When you’re ready, checkout to see your receipt and finish shopping.
- Exit the program when done.
